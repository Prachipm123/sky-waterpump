          Water pumps are extremely versatile tools that can solve a variety of
          problems and make your life easier than you ever thought possible.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          From a sprinkler pump for your lawn to a well pump for your home, to a
          sump pump on a job site, a submersible utility pump or a pump for
          flood cleanup, all pumps are designed to move water from one place
          (the basement) to another (outside).

        <h2>How to choose a water pump</h2>
        <br></br>

        <p>
          There are many different factors to consider in order to choose the
          perfect pump for your desired application.

          Electric water pumps Electric water pumps are ideal for indoor use.
          Most are 120V and will plug into a standard household outlet. If you
          choose the 230V variety, make sure you have the electrical cord to
          support it. While not as powerful as gas-powered models, electric
          water pumps require less maintenance because you don’t have to worry
          about oil changes and other maintenance. You’ll need to operate these
          units within the extension cord length of the power supply, so if you
          have mobile pumping needs, use a pneumatic model.

          Gas-powered water pumps Pneumatic water pumps are commonly used for
          irrigation on job sites and farms. With powerful engines, these pumps
          can deliver up to 750 gallons of water per minute (GPM). If you need
          to move large amounts of water, such as a flooded basement, then a gas
          dewatering pump is exactly what you need. IMPORTANT: Pneumatic pumps
          produce carbon monoxide emissions, so they must be used outdoors.

          Solar water pump (also known as photovoltaic water pump) is the most
          attractive water supply method in sunlight-rich areas in the world
          today, especially in remote areas where electricity is scarce. The
          operation of the solar water pump is controlled and adjusted. The
          electric energy from the solar array is used to drive the water pump,
          and the output frequency is adjusted in real time according to the
          variation of sunshine intensity, so that the output power is close to
          the maximum power of the solar cell array.

          The second most important thing to consider when choosing a water pump
          is the application you need it for. There are many types of pumps
          available and all are built for specialized applications. Click on the
          links below to learn more about each type of pump and its most common
          applications.

        <h2>How to properly size a water pump</h2>
        <br></br>

        <p>
          The next step in selecting the right pump is to make sure it is sized
          correctly. The most important factors to consider when sizing a pump
          boil down to the GPM/PSI rating, the inlet/outlet size of the water
          and hose, the height in vertical feet needed to pump the water, called
          the total head lift, and the distance needed to pump the water
          horizontally.
        </p>
        <br></br>

        <h2>Important factors to keep in mind</h2>
        <br></br>

        <p>
          Total head (THL), suction head (SH) and gallons per minute (GPM)
          ratings are all important indicators to guide you in sizing your pump,
          as they help determine how much water the pump can move and how fast
          the pump can move to get the job done.
        </p>
        <br></br>

        <p>
          Suction head is the vertical distance pumped from the water source to
          the pump. The higher the pumping needs to be, the more difficult it
          will be for the pump to resist gravity. This number is especially
          important for deep well applications or pond drainage.
        </p>
        <br></br>

        <p>
          Total Head is the total height from the water source to the final
          destination. This number will give you an estimate of the “power”
          required for the pump to move the water a certain distance.
        </p>
        <br></br>

        <p>
          Gallons per minute is a measure of how many gallons per minute the
          pump can move.
        </p>
        <br></br>

        <h2>How to choose an inlet/outlet size</h2>
        <br></br>

        <p>
          Water Pump Inlet Pipe If you need a pump with different inlet/outlet
          size options, then you just need to know that they work the same way
          regardless of their size. The pump draws in water through the inlet
          valve and discharges it through the discharge valve. a 4″ dewatering
          pump may do its job faster than a 1″ pump. Also, remember that no
          matter what size inlet your pump has, you must use that size inlet or
          suction hose. Do not reduce the diameter of the inlet/suction hose.
