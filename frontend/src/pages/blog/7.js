          Slurry is one of the most challenging fluids to work with. It is
          highly abrasive, thick, sometimes corrosive, and contains a high
          concentration of solids. There is no doubt that conveying slurries is
          difficult for pumps. But choosing the right pump for these material
          applications can have a significant long-term beneficial impact.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <h2>What is “slurry”?</h2>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Slurry is any mixture of fluid and fine solid particles. Examples of
          slurries include: manure, cement, starch or coal suspended in water.
          Slurries are used as a convenient way to handle solids in mining,
          steel processing, foundry, power generation, and more recently in frac
          sand mining.
        </p>
        <br></br>

        <p>
          Slurries typically behave in the same way as thick viscous fluids,
          flowing by gravity, but can also be pumped as needed. Slurries are
          divided into two main categories: non-settling or settling.
        </p>
        <br></br>

        <p>
          Non-settling slurries consist of very fine particles that create the
          illusion of increased apparent viscosity. These slurries usually have
          low wear characteristics, but require very careful consideration when
          selecting the right pump, as they behave differently than normal
          liquids.
        </p>
        <br></br>

        <p>
          Settling slurries are formed by coarse particles, and these particles
          tend to form unstable mixtures. Special attention should be paid to
          flow and power calculations when selecting a pump. Most slurry
          applications consist of coarse particles and therefore have a higher
          wear performance.
        </p>
        <br></br>

        <p>The following characteristics are common to slurries.</p>

        <p>
          Many types of pumps can be used to pump slurry, but the most common
          type of slurry pump is the centrifugal pump. Centrifugal slurry pumps
          use centrifugal force generated by a rotating impeller to impinge
          kinetic energy into the mud, similar to a watery liquid moving through
          a standard centrifugal pump.
        </p>
        <br></br>

        <p>
          Slurry applications significantly reduce the expected wear life of
          pumped components. It is critical to select a pump designed for these
          heavy-duty applications from the outset. Consider the following when
          making your selection.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <h2>Basic pump components</h2>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          To ensure that the pump can withstand wear, the impeller size/design,
          materials of construction and discharge configuration must be properly
          selected.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Open impellers are most common on slurry pumps because they are the
          least likely to clog. Closed impellers, on the other hand, are the
          most likely to clog and, if they do, the most difficult to clean.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Slurry impellers are large and thick. This helps them run longer in
          harsh slurry mixtures.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <h2>Slurry pump structure</h2>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Slurry pumps are typically larger in size and often require more
          horsepower to operate than lower viscosity liquid pumps because they
          are less efficient. Bearings and shafts must also be more robust and
          durable.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          To protect the pump casing from wear, slurry pumps are often lined
          with metal or rubber.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          The metal casing consists of carbide. These housings can withstand the
          erosion caused by increased pressure and circulation.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          The housing is selected to suit the application. For example, pumps
          used in cement production handle fine particles at low pressures.
          Therefore, lightweight construction of the housing is acceptable. If
          the pump handles rock, the pump casing and impeller will require a
          thicker and stronger casing.
        </p>
        <br></br>

        <p>
          Those who have experience pumping mud know that it is not an easy
          task. Slurries are heavy and difficult to pump. They can cause
          excessive wear on the pump and its components, and they can clog
          suction and discharge lines if they don’t move fast enough.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Making a slurry pump last a reasonable amount of time can be a
          challenge. But there are steps you can take to extend the life of your
          slurry pump and make pumping slurry less of a challenge.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <div className={styles.bullet}>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Find the best position to make the pump run as slowly as possible
              (to reduce wear) but fast enough to prevent solids from settling
              and clogging the line
            </li>
            <li>
              Reduce the pump discharge pressure to the lowest possible point in
              order to reduce wear
            </li>
            <li>
              Follow proper piping principles to ensure consistent and uniform
              delivery of the slurry to the pump
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Pumping slurry can present some challenges and problems, but with the
          right engineering and equipment selection, you can have long,
          trouble-free operation. It’s important to work with a qualified pump
          engineer when selecting a slurry pump, as mud can wreak havoc on a
          pump if not selected properly. Feel free to contact one of our pump
          engineers.
