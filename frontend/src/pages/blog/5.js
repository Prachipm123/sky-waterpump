        <p>
          Mechanical seals are a key component in centrifugal pump systems.
          These devices maintain the integrity of the pump system by preventing
          fluid leakage and keeping contaminants out. Mechanical seal systems
          are used in a variety of seal designs to detect leaks, control the
          sealing environment, and lubricate secondary seals.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          There are several mechanical seal types available depending on the
          pump type and process variant. Each seal variant has its own unique
          design and characteristics that make it suitable for a particular
          application.

        <h2>Different types of mechanical seals for centrifugal pumps</h2>
        <br></br>

        <p>
          Mechanical seal types vary in design, arrangement, and how they
          disperse the hydraulic pressure acting on their surfaces. The most
          common types of seals include

            <li>Unbalanced seals</li>

        <h3>Balanced and unbalanced seals</h3>
        <br></br>

        <p>
          A balanced mechanical seal device is a system in which the forces
          acting on the seal faces are balanced. Due to the lower end loads, the
          seal faces are more evenly lubricated and the seal life is longer.
        </p>
        <br></br>

        <p>
          Balanced mechanical seals are particularly suitable for higher
          operating pressures, typically above 200 PSIG. They are also a good
          choice when handling low lubricity and highly volatile fluids.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Unbalanced mechanical seal types are often used as a more economical
          alternative to more complex balanced seals. Unbalanced seals may also
          exhibit less product leakage due to tighter control of the mask, but
          the result will exhibit a much lower mean time between failures.
          Unbalanced seals are not recommended for high pressure or most
          hydrocarbon applications.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <h3>Pusher and non-pusher seals</h3>
        <br></br>

        <p>
          Pusher seals utilize one or more springs to maintain the seal closing
          force. The springs can be in the rotating or stationary element of a
          mechanical seal. Pushrod seals can provide a seal at very high
          pressures, but have a disadvantage because the elastomer beneath the
          main sealing surface is subject to wear as that surface moves along
          the shaft/sleeve during operation.
        </p>
        <br></br>

        <p>
          Non-push type seals use metal or elastomeric bellows to maintain the
          seal closing force. These seals are well suited for dirty and high
          temperature applications. Bellows seals are limited to medium/low
          pressure applications.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Both pusher and non-pusher designs are available in balanced and
          unbalanced configurations.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <h3>Conventional mechanical seals</h3>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Conventional seals are typically lower cost and are typically
          installed on general service equipment. These seals require a higher
          level of operator skill to perform maintenance as they are installed
          as separate components.
        </p>

        <h3>Packaged seals</h3>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Packaged mechanical seals integrate all sealing elements into one
          assembly. This greatly reduces the possibility of assembly errors and
          the time required to replace.

        <h2>
          Key considerations when choosing different types of mechanical seals
          for pumps
        </h2>
        <br></br>

        <p>
          When determining the type of seal system for a centrifugal pump, the
          operator needs to make a selection based on its unique application.
          Failure to select the correct seal type can result in loss of pump
          integrity, failure and costly repairs. To avoid these undesirable
          results, all operators must consider the following factors before
          making a decision.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <h3>The type of fluid to be pumped</h3>

        <br></br>
        <p>
          The fluid you are pumping is one of the most important factors to
          consider when deciding on a seal type.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Factors such as cleanliness, lubricity and volatility can
          significantly affect the design of mechanical seals and seal support
          systems.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <h3>Pump Fluid Pressure</h3>

        <br></br>
        <p>
          The amount of pressure applied to the mechanical seal face has a
          significant effect on its performance. If the pump is to be operated
          at low pressure, an unbalanced mechanical seal will be appropriate.
          However, under conditions where higher pressures are expected, a
          balanced seal will prove to be a more reliable solution.
        </p>

        <br></br>
        <h3>Temperature Considerations</h3>

        <br></br>
        <p>
          Balanced mechanical seals perform better than unbalanced mechanical
          seals under conditions where the operating temperature is higher than
          normal. Thermally sensitive components are better protected in
          balanced mechanical seals than in other seal types.
        </p>

        <br></br>
        <h3>Operator Safety Issues</h3>

        <br></br>
        <p>
          With all types of machinery, operator safety is of paramount
          importance. The use of double mechanical seals in centrifugal pumps
          provides additional protection because they increase sealing capacity
          and are generally more reliable.
