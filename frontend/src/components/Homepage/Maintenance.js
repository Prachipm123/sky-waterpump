                  these pumps are also called rotary pumps, and these are very
                  competitive because of the fact that they remove air from the
                  lines and therefore get rid of air leakage. These are also
                  efficient while dealing with high-viscosity fluids. The main
                  disadvantage of these pumps is that they need extremely little
                  clearance among the revolving pump & the external edge of the
                  unit. Consequently, the revolution must happen at extremely
                  slow speeds. When the water pump is functioned at high speeds,
                  then the fluid can ultimately decrease the efficiency of the
                  pump.
